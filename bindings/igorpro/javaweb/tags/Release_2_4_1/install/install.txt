Simply copy or create a shortcut as described:

[IGOR BINDING]\iproc-files\tango_loader.ipf --goes to--> [IGOR INSTALL]\Igor Procedures

[IGOR BINDING]\iproc-files\tango_monitor.ipf --goes to--> [IGOR INSTALL]\User Procedures
[IGOR BINDING]\iproc-files\tango_panel.ipf --goes to--> [IGOR INSTALL]\User Procedures
[IGOR BINDING]\iproc-files\tango.ipf --goes to--> IGOR INSTALL]\User Procedures
[IGOR BINDING]\iproc-files\tango_tools.ipf --goes to--> [IGOR INSTALL]\User Procedures
[IGOR BINDING]\iproc-files\tango_code_generator.ipf --goes to--> [IGOR INSTALL]\User Procedures

[IGOR BINDING]\xop\tango_binding.xop --goes to--> [IGOR INSTALL]\Igor Extensions

We now need to help Igor to locate the required TANGO libraries. The aim is to make sure that 
Igor is running in a context in which it can access the TANGO libraries located into [IGOR BINDING]\xop.

You can do that using the system PATH env. variable. You can also edit [IGOR BINDING]\install\start-igorpro.bat
then adapt <path-to-your-tango-binding-root-directory> to the situation, finally, create a shortcut of this 
file on your desktop:
 
[IGOR BINDING]\start-igorpro.bat --goes to--> your desktop [start Igor using this script]

It is HIGHLY recommended to read the introduction of the [IGOR BINDING]\tutorial\tutorial.ipf file.
