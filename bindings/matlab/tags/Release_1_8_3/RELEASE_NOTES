//=============================================================================
// RELEASE 1.8.3 - 02/2009 - Nicolas Leclercq - SOLEIL
//=============================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTE:
- The present release requires TANGO 5.2 or higher.

FEATURES:
- Nothing really new - minor changes  (64-bits support in progress)
- Binding recompiled using VC8 under Windows
  
  Please send bug report, comment or suggestion to the Tango mailing list.
   
//=============================================================================
// RELEASE 1.6.0 - 01/30/06 - Nicolas Leclercq - SOLEIL
//=============================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTE:
- The present release requires TANGO 5.2 or higher.

FEATURES:
- Full support for TANGO 5.x features
  Added full support for writable sprectrum and image attributes. This feature
  is fully tested under Windows (tango_reg_test.m upgraded). More tests required
  under Linux and SOLARIS but should be stable.

//=============================================================================
// RELEASE 1.5.0 - 02/24/05 - Nicolas Leclercq - SOLEIL
//=============================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTE:
- The present release requires the very last version of the Tango::Group C++ 
  class. This Tango::Group version should be released with TANGO 5.2 but is
	already available on TANGO CVS repository (sourceforge). You can also 
  disable the TANGO group features when compiling the binding. In this case 
  add -DDISABLE_TANGO_GROUP_SUPPORT to your CC flags.

FEATURES:
- Support for TANGO 5.x
  Added support for new attribute types 
	Support for writting spectrum and/or image attribute is partial and not 
        fully tested.
- Fixed a bug in TANGO groups.
- Fixed ORB shutdown problem in TANGO core library. The binding can now be 
  safely loaded/unloaded using the  Matlab clear function (e.g. clear all). 
  No more crash under both Windows and Linux - to be confirmed under Solaris. 

KNOWN PROBLEMS/BUGS:
- When compiling the binding for Windows, Microsoft Visual C++ 6 reports
  some "name truncation" warnings (C4786) even if this warning is explicitly
  disabled using a pragma. This is a known bug of Microsoft Visual C++ 6
  (only fixed in msvc7). You can safely ignore them.

NOTE:
- There is no plan to support TANGO events in matlab unless someone out there
  knows how to handle a pure asynchronous mechanism under matlab. In other
  words, we would like the implementation to fit with the event model by not
  requiring the user to poll events locally.

//=============================================================================
FEATURES:
- Support for TANGO 4.0.0
- Added support for TANGO groups.
- Fixed ORB shutdown problem in TANGO core library. The binding can now be

// RELEASE 1.3.1 - 06/12/03 - Nicolas Leclercq - SOLEIL
//=============================================================================
FEATURES:
- Support for TANGO 3.0.1

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed a bug in command_inout_asynch.m and command_inout_reply.m.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/BUGS:
- Matlab crashes is you unload the mex-file (using the clear all or clear
  functions command). The underlying ORB destruction does not seem to be
  correctly handled in the context of a mex-file. A simple workaround is
  to keep the mex-file in memory during your matlab session.

  Please send bug report, comment or suggestion to the Tango mailing list.

//=============================================================================
// RELEASE 1.3.0 - 06/05/03 - Nicolas Leclercq - SOLEIL
//=============================================================================
FEATURES:
- Support for TANGO 3.0.0 (asynch. version of DeviceProxy's main methods)

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed a bug in MexArgs::get_input_array.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/BUGS:

  functions command). The underlying ORB destruction does not seem to be

// RELEASE 1.2.0 - 03/03/03 - Nicolas Leclercq - SOLEIL
//=============================================================================
FEATURES:
- Support for Matlab R13
- Support for TANGO 2.2.0

KNOWN PROBLEMS/BUGS:
- Matlab crashes is you unload the mex-file (using the clear all or clear
  functions command). The underlying ORB destruction does not seem to be

//=============================================================================
// RELEASE 1.1.0 - 09/17/02 - Nicolas Leclercq - SOLEIL
//=============================================================================
FEATURES:
- Added device property support (get, put, delete single or several properties)

KNOWN PROBLEMS/BUGS:
- No known bug.

  Please send bug report, comment or suggestion to the Tango mailing list.

//=============================================================================
// RELEASE 1.0.0 - 09/10/02 - Nicolas Leclercq - SOLEIL
//=============================================================================
FEATURES:
- First public release
- This version maps 95% of the Tango::DevProxy class features (property 
  oriented methods are not implemented)
- There is no automatic/systematic data type conversion. For instance, the 
  binding does NOT systematically convert floats to doubles. The user
  always manipulates the numerical type expected or sent by the device.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/BUGS:
- No known bug.
